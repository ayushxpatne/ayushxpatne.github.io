## msc advanced computer science (ai)
**university of leeds | 2025 — 2026**

## b.tech ai & data science
**viit, pune | 2021 — 2025**

# experience

## founder · hopps
**september 2024 — june 2025 | pune, india**

* led cross-functional product development for a food-tech platform serving ::y::70+ restaurant partners:: and 20+ beta users.
* engineered an ai-powered recommendation system using ::b::gemini api::, firebase, and flutter to deliver personalized dining suggestions.
* architected evolution from keyword extraction to ::p::embedding-based semantic retrieval::, identifying production bottlenecks in api latency and cost-per-query constraints.
* implemented production safeguards including ::y::rate limiting:: (3 ai bio generations/user/day) and api key rotation for cost management during beta.
* mentored 2 engineering interns on recommendation system architecture and mobile development, conducting code reviews and technical guidance.

## research intern · iim udaipur
**september 2023 — april 2024 | remote**

* built an automated classification system processing ::y::250,000+ nft records:: using python and hugging face to differentiate ai-generated vs. human-created content.
* engineered asynchronous data collection infrastructure using ::b::asyncio and multithreading:: to scrape 113,000+ web pages with optimized throughput.
* explored cloud-based distributed scraping architecture on ::p::gcp cloud functions:: for ip rotation and scalable data collection.
* developed automated preprocessing workflows applying nlp techniques that led to ::y::two research manuscripts::.

## ai intern · konverge.ai
**august 2023 — october 2023 | nagpur, india**

* applied statistical modeling and machine learning for customer segmentation, purchase prediction, and profitability analysis.
* built ::b::sentiment classification model:: using nlp techniques to analyze user reviews and extract actionable insights.
* developed data preprocessing pipelines and visualizations to communicate model performance and business recommendations.

# projects

## maira · ai companion system  [live demo](https://trymaira.web.app/early-access/landing) 

* engineered a ::p::rag-based memory system:: integrating ::b::gemini 2.0 api:: with sqlite embedding retrieval using semantic similarity thresholds for context injection.
* designed a parallel memory pipeline leveraging gemini to analyze message history, extracting ::y::categorized memories with importance scoring:: and redundancy detection.
* built full-stack architecture using flutter, firebase, getx, and gcp cloud functions to track persistent user context and emotional states.
* implemented fluid chat ux inspired by ::p::imessage design principles:: for judgment-free companionship with long-term context persistence.

## social media recommendation engine  [blog](https://ayushxpatne.github.io/ayushpatne/blog/social-media-algorithm)  [live demo](https://social-media-algo-code.onrender.com) 

* engineered a tiktok-style recommendation engine using ::y::python, flask, and faiss:: for semantic video retrieval.
* implemented ::b::indexivf clustering:: with approximate nearest neighbor search to efficiently query 3072-dimensional embeddings across 500+ videos.
* designed ::p::sliding window user preference model:: (last 5 interactions) with 70-30 exploitation-exploration split to balance relevance and discovery.
* built multi-signal scoring system across 6 interaction types to capture nuanced user preferences.

## brewstories · llm fine-tuning for creative text generation

* fine-tuned ::y::tinyllama transformer (1.1b parameters):: on 10,000-story dataset using pytorch and hugging face transformers.
* developed end-to-end training workflow including dataset preparation, tokenization, fine-tuning, and evaluation for generative text modeling.
* achieved ::b::runner-up recognition:: at visionary techfest 24 ai/ml hackathon organized by binghamton university.

## distributed training infrastructure · fraud detection  [full project overview](https://ayushxpatne.github.io/ayushpatne/blog/fl-eth-dissertation) 

* architected ::p::federated learning system:: enabling privacy-preserving collaborative training across 3 distributed clients over 10 rounds.
* engineered data processing pipeline for highly imbalanced ethereum datasets (90%+ class imbalance), applying ::y::smote oversampling:: and feature engineering.
* developed fraud detection classifier achieving ::b::99.7% auc-roc and 96.6% recall:: on transaction pattern analysis.
* built flask-based visualization dashboard to monitor performance metrics and communicate fraud pattern insights.
