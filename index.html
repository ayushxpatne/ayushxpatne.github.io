        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="about-snippet">
            <p>I am an AI engineer pursuing my MSc in AI at the University of Leeds, passionate about generative AI and building systems that people actually use. So far, I've focused on creating AI and ML systems, developing end-to-end pipelines, and contributing to a few research projects along the way. I'm curious about exploring AI research more deeply and always up for new challenges.</p>
            <p>This site is where I document what I build and how I build it. Think build logs, technical breakdowns, and lessons learned from shipping AI products.</p>
