Heya Folks! Welcome back, this time we will be helping a surf shop owner to setup cloud. So he has his servers setup (not on cloud, pfft! imagine that? ) and he wants to migrate to cloud (good move) but he is concerned about the costs. He noticed that his website is much more active in day compared to night, so he was thinking, if there is a way to make the servers flexible.

Thats where we come, and tell him how we only pay for what we use in AWS, and the fact that we can shut down instances when we dont need them. 

And the best part? AWS can help match his exact hardware specification on cloud. 

But what if the traffic increases? well gues what b\*\*\*\*\*s, AWS scales as per the traffic and scales down when it reduces. V cool imo. Anyways.. 

Introducing... AWS Price Calculator. 

AWS Price Calculator helps us estimate the "no-commitment" cost for our requirements. 

Visit https://calculator.aws to do it. 

Here we select region and services we are gonna use, and it will calculate the price for it. It doesnt get simpler than this folks. 

Yeah this was a short Task. But very useful tho. 

See you in next one!
